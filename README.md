## About

This repository is an **unofficial fork** of *Summertime Saga*, cloned for **educational and learning purposes only**. It is **not affiliated** with Kompas Productions or DarkCookie, and is **not intended** to distribute, monetize, or replace the original game.

It exists as a sandbox to study a large, real-world Ren'Py project.

## Goals

What this fork is used to explore:

| Area | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Ren'Py scripting** | Language syntax, screens, labels, transitions |
| **Game structure** | How a large VN codebase is organized |
| **Game logic** | Routes, event triggers, variables, flags |
| **Assets** | How sprites, audio, and images are wired in |
| **Modding** | Safe modification and experimentation workflows |
| **Reverse engineering** | Reading and understanding existing code |

> [!NOTE]
> This is **not** a replacement for the official game and provides **no** playable alternative.

## Requirements

- **[Ren'Py SDK](https://www.renpy.org/latest.html)** — latest stable version
- A machine capable of running Ren'Py
- Basic **Python** and visual-novel scripting knowledge

---

## Getting Started

1. Install the **Ren'Py SDK**.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/albertolicea00/SummertimeSaga-fork
   ```
   > `--depth=1` skips the heavy `.git` history.

    Strip large files from history (destructive — work on a copy):

    - **[git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo)** (recommended)
    - **[BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/)**
3. Open the **Ren'Py Launcher**.
4. Add / select this project folder.
5. Run the project, or open the scripts to explore.
